  <h1>CSAFE TOOLS</h1>
  <p> CSAFE Tools is a software suite of state-of-the-art statistical libraries designed to assist practitioners in analyzing forensic data. This work was developed in collaboration with the Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence (CSAFE) at Iowa State University and Omni Analytics Group.

    The methods used in the handwriter package are open-source and transparent. The statistical methods employed in Scenario 1 are described in [1]. The underlying code is available as a <a href='https://github.com/CSAFE-ISU/handwriterRF' target='_blank'>GitHub repository</a>. The statistical methods employed in Scenario 2 are described in [2, 3]. The underlying code is available as a <a href='https://github.com/CSAFE-ISU/handwriter' target='_blank'>GitHub repository</a>. This repository contains the development version. The current version is available on the <a href='https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/handwriter/index.html' target='_blank'>Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)</a>.
