  <h2>Prepare the Handwriting Samples</h2>
  If you downloaded handwriting samples from the CSAFE Handwriting Database, the samples are ready to go! Otherwise,
      <ol>
      <li>Save the handwriting samples as PNG images.
      </li>
      <li>Rename each image file to include the writer ID and the document name in each file name.       
      <ul>
          <li>
            Example file names from the CSAFE Handwriting Database: "w0001_s01_pLND_r01.png", "w0001_s01_pLND_r02.png", "w0002_s01_pLND_r01.png", "w0002_s01_pLND_r02.png".
          </li>
          <li>The writer IDs need to be the same number of characters and in the same location in each file name. They can contain letters and numbers. E.g. the CSAFE Handwriting Database writer IDs are "w0001", "w0002", and so on.</li>
          <li>The document names also need to be the same number of characters and in the same location in each file name. E.g. the CSAFE Handwriting Database uses document names like "s01_pLND_r01" to refer to the session number, prompt code, and repetition number.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
