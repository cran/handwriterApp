Handwriter is designed to assist forensic examiners by analyzing
handwritten documents against a closed set of potential writers. It
determines the probability that each writer wrote the document. Whether
you are a forensic document examiner, legal professional, academic, or
simply curious about how statistics are applied to handwriting,
handwriter provides an automated way to evaluate handwriting samples.

  RStudio.
